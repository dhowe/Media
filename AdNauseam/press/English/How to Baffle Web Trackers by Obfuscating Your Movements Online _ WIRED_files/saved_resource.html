<p>Nothing like streamlining "click theft" and draining the ad budgets of legitimate companies trying to sell products.</p><p>Just wondering: How much would it cost Wired Mag if 10 of us on this page used a click script to generate 100 views a second and left our computers on all night for 8 hours. How much would this cost Wired? I'm curious as to how the pricing structure actually works.</p>

<p>Ads aren't served from the Wired server so no cost for them there. Clicks could cost the advertising companies a bit if they pay for CPM but most smart advertisers pay a commission based on a sale. Unless you want to do plain old fashioned branding (and then CPM is useful). But then ; the ad networks aren't stupid. If they see dozens of requests from your IP and browser they'd stop serving ads after a while since they understand it's useless to show you any more.</p>

<p>This seems like a possibly interesting strategy, but I wonder--  if it might be possible for sites to determine if it's an automated click or a human click based on any additional activity that may occur after arriving at the target page (if there is none, it could be deemed to be an auto-click), or if the timing between clicks could be discovered to be too short to be anything but automated.   Might this mechanism cause some kind of arms race?   Then again, sites may not care and if they're getting ad revenue based on the sheer number of initial clicks, the wouldn't want to change that gravy train, though the advertisers themselves might want to figure out some way to differentiate "AdNauseam" clicks from legit ones.</p>

<p>I also wonder if sites might add javascript that verifies that the position of the mouse is where it would need to be to click the link, and if not, ignores it.   I presume AdNauseam doesn't move the mouse pointer to make the clicks...</p>
